# Construction fixtures

Every layout here exists to measure **what a `constructions` entry becomes in a
fight**, and nothing else. The rule they measure is
[`constructions.md`](../../../docs/rules/constructions.md)'s: a construction is
placed once and arrives as `count` objects, each with its own life, its own
box and its own place in the row.

They are read, not fought. What each one answers is `fight buildings`, which
matches a recording's building rows back to the placements the layout declares,
because a recording says a row's `BuildingType` and not which construction
released it.

| Fixture | What it separates | Reading |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shape.yaml` | one placement against the objects it owns | wall **5**, each turret **1** |
| `shape.yaml` (red) | the layout's constructions against the opening's | two towers, no construction |
| `wall-passage.yaml` | a wall against the side that placed it | crosses it, all five at full life |
| `wall-block.yaml` | a wall against the other side | stops and attacks, four down |

`shape.mcscript` and `wall.mcscript` record them and carry every number as an
`expect`, so a fixture and the measurement that reads it are one file to
rerun.

The two wall fixtures are the same unit and the same geometry asked of both
sides, which is the only way the wall's own description — that it sinks into
the ground for a friendly unit — could have been separated from a wall that
never obstructs anyone. It never obstructs anyone: a Crawler ends up 0.567
metres from a block's centre on the side that placed it and 0.711 on the other,
against a block radius of 4.

`wall-passage.yaml` keeps red's Marksman out of reach of the wall on purpose.
The first version of it put the Marksman opposite the wall, and the Marksman
destroyed a block outright before the Crawlers arrived — one shot of 2329
against a block's 1112 — which measured a different thing.

**Half of each reading was predicted and half was measured**, and the script
says which is which beside each line. `config/constructions.yaml` gave the
counts, the lives and the boxes before the recording existed; where the five
blocks of a wall stand did not come from it, because the two fields that look
like they should say — `block_width` and `space` — span 83 metres across a
footprint 60 wide.

## What is not measured here

**A construction with more than one row.** The Magnetic Barrier is the only one
the build holds, and this build cannot place it: a layout compiles it, but the
release is refused by the game — `ConstructionElement` is created and the
action performed, and `ConstructionManager` then holds no element at that
index. So the row of five is the whole of what the geometry rests on, and
`constructions.md` states the generalisation as open rather than as a formula
fitted to one wall.

**What a construction does on its own.** A turret carries a `skill_id` and
2748 or 82 of damage, and a Magnetic Barrier slows what comes near it. Neither
is here. A wall's own doing is here, because a wall does nothing except stand
and be shot, which is what the two wall fixtures establish.

**A unit that does not fit between two blocks.** Every reading here is a
Crawler, 1.5 metres of inner radius against gaps 4 metres wide. A wall does not
obstruct one, and that says nothing about a unit the gaps could not admit even
if the blocks were solid.
